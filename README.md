# Bank Churn Prediction 🏦📉

End-to-end Data Science project aiming to predict customer churn in the banking sector using machine learning.

The primary business objective was to build a model that identifies customers at risk of leaving, while maintaining a strategic balance between **Recall** (catching churners) and **Precision** (avoiding false alarms) to optimize retention campaign budgets.

## 📌 Key Results & Business Recommendations

After experimenting with multiple algorithms, **XGBoost** was selected as the production model ("Champion Model").

| Metric | Score (Test Set) | Business Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ROC-AUC** | **0.88** | Excellent ability to distinguish between loyal and churning customers. |
| **Recall** | **64%** | The model detects nearly 2/3 of all customers who are actually leaving. |
| **Precision** | **66%** | When the model flags a risk, it is correct 66% of the time (minimizing "spam" and costs). |

### What drives churn? (Insights)
Model analysis (SHAP & Feature Importance) revealed critical risk factors:
1.  **Number of Products:** Customers with **3 or 4 products** are in the critical risk group. However, having exactly 2 products significantly increases loyalty.
2.  **Age:** The **45-60 age demographic** shows a much higher tendency to resign.
3.  **Activity:** Inactive members (`IsActiveMember = 0`) are significantly more likely to churn.

**Strategic Recommendation:**
Focus retention efforts on **inactive clients aged 45+ holding >2 products**. Due to the model's high precision, the bank can safely offer this segment higher-value incentives (e.g., cash bonuses) with minimal risk of wasting budget on customers who would have stayed anyway.

## 📊 Visualizations

### 1. Model Decision Factors (SHAP Values)
The plot below illustrates how specific features impact the probability of churn.
*(It clearly shows that older age [red dots] pushes the decision towards Churn [to the right]).*

### 2. Model Effectiveness (Confusion Matrix)
The model effectively minimizes false positives, accurately identifying high-risk customers while avoiding unnecessary interventions for loyal clients, thereby making retention campaigns more cost-efficient and maximizing the bank’s overall return on investment.

## ⚙️ Methodology & Process

The project was executed in the following stages:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Identified a non-linear relationship between product count and churn.
    * Detected a strong correlation between age and customer decisions.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Scaling numerical features (`StandardScaler`).
    * One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables (Geography, Gender).
    * Dropping irrelevant identifiers (`CustomerId`, `Surname`).
3.  **Handling Class Imbalance:**
    * The dataset was imbalanced (80% Retained / 20% Churned).
    * Applied **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) strictly on the training set to prevent data leakage.
4.  **Modeling & Evaluation:**
    * **Baseline:** Logistic Regression (High Recall, but very low Precision - too "aggressive").
    * **Challenger:** Random Forest (Good performance, handled non-linearity well).
    * **Final:** **XGBoost** + Hyperparameter Tuning (`RandomizedSearchCV`). Achieved the best F1-Score balance.
